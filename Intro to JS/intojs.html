            <h1>An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
            <p>Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, 
                what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies 
                play well with it.</p>
            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p><i>JavaScript</i> was initially created to "make a   web pages alive".</p>
            <br><p>The programs in this language are called <i>scripts.</i> They can be 
                written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.</p>
            <p>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>
            <br><p>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called <a href="#">Java.</a></p>
            <div class="history">
                <p>When JavaScript was created., it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time,
                    so it was decided that positioning as new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.</p>
                <br><p>But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called <a href="#">ECMAScript,</a> 
                    and now ithas no relation to Java at all.</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>Today JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has special program called
                <a href="#">the JavaScript engine.</a></p>
            <div class="footer">
                <h4>How does Engine works?</h4>
                <br><p>Engines are complicated. But basics are easy.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parses") the script.</li>
                    <li>Then it converts ("complies") the script to the machine language.</li>
                    <li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The engine applies optimization at each step of the process, it even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and</p>
